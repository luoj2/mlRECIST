# Summary:
Code for model, figures and statistics written for this project include the following:
* ml-RECIST: TensorFlow-based fully connected natural language processing neural network 
- implementation details are found in the manuscript
* Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) with area under the curve (AUC) estimates
* Survival curves using Kaplan-Meier estimates
* Waterfall plot
* Scatter plot
* Vertical stacked bar plot
Data includes the following:
* Reduced dataset of output from ml-RECIST for the training, internal validation and external validation sets

# Installation:
The scripts are dependent on the following packages:
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
